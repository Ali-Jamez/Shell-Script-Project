# Shell-Based Graphical Alarm Clock:  
An alarm clock is a utility application designed to notify or alert the user at a specified time. In this project, we have developed an Alarm Clock using Shell scripting integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI). The script allows users to set a specific time at which an audio alarm is triggered. This project showcases the capabilities of shell scripting in handling real-time events, integrating multimedia, and providing user interaction through GUI components
